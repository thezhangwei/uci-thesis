% Uncomment the following two lines to use the algorithm package,
% which provides an algorithm environment similar to figure and table
% ("\begin{algorithm}...\end{algorithm}"). A list of algorithms will
% automatically be added in the preliminary pages. Note that you
% probably want a package for the actual code to go with this (e.g.,
% algorithmic).
%\usepackage{algorithm}
%\renewcommand{\listalgorithmname}{\protect\centering\protect\Large LIST OF ALGORITHMS}

% Uncomment the following line to enable Unicode support. This will allow you
% to enter non-ASCII characters (such as accented characters) directly without
% having to use LaTeX's awkward escape syntax (e.g., \'{e})
% NOTE: You may have to install the ucs.sty package for this to work. See:
% http://www.unruh.de/DniQ/latex/unicode/
%\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}

% Uncomment the following to avoid "widowing", where page breaks cause
% single lines of paragraphs to float onto the next page (this is not
% a UCI requirement but more of an aesthetic choice).
%\widowpenalty=10000
%\clubpenalty=10000
